# MATCHA

2nd Web project for 42 school, Matcha is a dating site (made in React / Nodejs): 

This project was done with [Benjamin Tollie](https://github.com/BenjaminTle).

I did the front (UI/UX) of the project and Benjamin the back (using Neo4j)

## What is Matcha ?

## How to use it ?
First launch Neo4j: `neo4j start` (_if you haven't installed it run:_ `don't know yet` _before_)

_If you haven't install npm run:_ `don't know yet`

Finally in the main directory and the api folder run:
 ```
 npm i
 npm start
 ```

And you're good to go ;)

__Nb:__ Some features (like localisation) will not work unless you provide an google api key.
